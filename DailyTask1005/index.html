              Deafor: Ungroup Data in an Object <br><br>

              You volunteered to help out teaching a preschool in your area! You were given an array of all students and some important data about them, grouped by their teacher. Create a function that will ungroup every student so you can look at their details individually. 
              <br><br>
              Example: <br><br>
              
              ungroupStudents([{ <br>
                teacher: "Ms. Car", <br>
                data: [{ <br>
                   name: "James", <br>
                   emergenceNumber: "617-771-1082", <br>
                }, { <br>
                   name: "Alice", <br>
                   alergies: ["nuts", "carrots"], <br>
                }], <br>
              }, { <br>
                teacher: "Mr. Lamb", <br>
                data: [{ <br>
