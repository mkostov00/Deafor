            Task: <br> Build a Simple Banking Application using Prototypes
            <br>
You are required to build a simple banking application using prototypes in JavaScript. The application should allow users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money from their accounts.
<br>
Each account should have a balance, and the application should perform validation checks to ensure that users cannot withdraw more money than they have in their accounts.
<br><br>
Here are the steps to follow:
<br>
Create a prototype for a bank account. The prototype should contain a constructor that accepts an initial balance, and methods for depositing and withdrawing money.
<br>
Use the prototype to create new bank accounts.
<br>
Implement validation checks to ensure that users cannot withdraw more money than they have in their accounts.
<br>
Create a user interface for the banking application using HTML and CSS.
<br>
Use JavaScript to handle user input and update the user interface to reflect the current state of the bank accounts.
<br>
Test the application to ensure that it works as expected.
