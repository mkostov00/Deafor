            <h2>JS - Exercise - INHERITANCE</h2>
            <h4>
                Build an e-commerce application that sells different types of products with varying properties,
such as price, size, and color. The application should use inheritance to create a base product
class that contains the shared properties and methods of all products, and then create
subclasses that inherit from the base class and add their own unique properties and methods.
<br>
To accomplish this, you should start by creating a Product class with properties such as price,
size, and color. This class should also contain methods that all products will have, such as a
method to display the product information.
<br>
Next, you should create subclasses for each type of product that you want to sell, such as
Clothing, Electronics, or Books. These subclasses should inherit from the Product class and add
their own unique properties and methods. For example, the Clothing class might have a size
property and a method to calculate the appropriate size based on the user's measurements.
<br>
Once you have created the necessary classes, you can use them to create instances of each
product type in your e-commerce application. You should provide a way for users to view the
available products, add them to a shopping cart, and make a purchase.<br>

This task will help you understand how to use inheritance in JavaScript to create classes with
shared properties and methods, as well as how to create subclasses that inherit from a base
class and add their own unique properties and methods. It will also give you practice in building
a simple e-commerce application, which is a common use case for web development
